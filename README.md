IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS!
1. An Arduino Mega1280 or Mega2560.
2. Populated external BANKED RAM: Andy Brown or Rugged Circuits RAM shield.

My development platform is Arduino Mega1280, and Rugged Circuits QuadRAM.
I do not own a Mega2560, or the Andy Brown shield. If you do, you may need to
do some adjustments. Patches are welcome, of course.
