* IMPORTANT! PLEASE USE Arduino 1.0.5 or better!
* Older versions HAVE MAJOR BUGS AND WILL NOT WORK AT ALL!
* Use of gcc-avr and lib-c that is newer than the Arduino version is even better.

This small sketch tests:
	xmem2 multitasking

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS!
1. An Arduino Mega1280 or Mega2560 or Teensy++ 2.0.
2. Populated external BANKED RAM: Andy Brown or Rugged Circuits RAM shield.

My development platform is Arduino Mega1280/Mega2560/Teensy++2.0, 
and Rugged Circuits QuadRAM. I do not own the Andy Brown shield. 
You may need to do some adjustments for hardware I do not own.
If you want to send me an Andy Brown shield, that would help me support you better.
Patches are welcome, of course.
