* IMPORTANT! PLEASE USE Arduino 1.0.5 or better!
* Older versions HAVE MAJOR BUGS AND WILL NOT WORK AT ALL!
* Use of gcc-avr and lib-c that is newer than the Arduino version is even better.

	xmem2 multitasking

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS!
1. An Arduino Mega1280 or Mega2560.
2. Populated external BANKED RAM: Andy Brown or Rugged Circuits RAM shield.

My development platform is Arduino Mega1280, and Rugged Circuits QuadRAM.
I do not own the Andy Brown shield. If you do, you may need to do some 
adjustments. Patches are welcome, of course.
